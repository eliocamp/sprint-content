    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis is the first lesson in the module on the Ethos of Open Science. We’ll start explaining what we mean by the word, “ethos”. Ethos is defined by Merriam-Webster as “the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution”. So this lesson is about what makes Open Science, as an approach to knowledge-production, unique or distinguishable from other scientific methods.\nNote that “ethos” is not exactly “ethics”, but it is a broad enough term to include the moral attitudes held by the individuals or institutions practicing open science. To make it clear that there is a moral element to this discussion, we speak of “responsible Open Science” going forward.\nThe lesson introduces the concept of open science as a whole, by explaining the history underpinning open science, what open science is, and how it works. It then discusses different components of open science and the pillars that make them up. At the end of the lesson, students will have an understanding of the brief history of open science and its definition.\nOpen science goes beyond publishing– it is a redefinition of scientific collaboration and output. It is a culture intended to promote science and its social impact. Open science creates new opportunities for different stakeholders including researchers, decision makers, and public participants. Open science increases study transparency, repeatability, reproducibility, and confirmation. We expand what these terms mean and why they matter throughout this module and later OpenCore modules."

    "section": "Context and Definition",
    "text": "Context and Definition\nScience evolves through collaborative development of theories and practices that are open for others to learn and build on. Throughout the ages - whilst in some cases, education and science was out of reach for the general populace and may have been kept for a privileged few, there have been other educational and scientific resources that were purposefully made available for others to re-use. Think of how dictionaries and encyclopedias have been around for centuries specifically to share standards of knowledge. (The first “dictionary” dates back over 3,000 years!) Libraries, in turn, have existed for millennia to serve as repositories of knowledge in diverse formats, from ancient tablets and scrolls, to the books we expect to see today. Public museums have also been around for some time and play the role of educating people, as well as maintaining archives for researchers to gain further insights from.\nInstitutions and practices throughout the ages have facilitated humanity’s endless desire for knowledge. As far back as the Medieval era, we already find physicians being encouraged to review one another’s work to ensure it was carried out appropriately (Rogers, 2021). Today, we call this practice “peer review”. And, during the Enlightenment, scientists formed networks with whom they shared their theories via hand-written letters, and the adoption of the printer allowed for the emergence of scientific institutes and journals (Green, 2017; see Kherroubi Garcia et al., 2022).\nHowever, open science has only become a distinct set of practices in recent decades. We can see open science as both being encouraged by social and technological developments, and responding to problems in the scientific process. The emergence of the internet and other digital technologies have more recently allowed for science to be conducted even more collaboratively. In 1971, Project Gutenberg started making books in the 📖public domain📖 available online. In 1987, we saw the first open access 📖journal📖 being published. In 1991 the central storage platform arXiv was launched for the exchange of manuscripts in physics (though without 📖peer review📖) (Ginsparg, 2021).\nHowever, these endeavors do not amount to open science in the sense we discuss it today. In recent years, we have learned of various issues in the scientific process that necessitate specific responses. Two such issues are the 📖replication crisis📖 (Fidler & Gordon, 2013; Elsherif et al., 2021a) and 📖publication bias📖 (Joober, et al., 2012; Elsherif et al., 2021b). The replication crisis refers to scientific findings not being validated by other scientists’ efforts to replicate them. The publication bias amounts to the greater ease to publish scientific findings that only “very clearly” confirm or disprove hypotheses.\nThus, open science captures both the spirit of making knowledge more accessible and responding to poor scientific practices. We will discuss more reasons why open science is important, both the personal benefits and as a public good, in 🔗Lesson 2 of this module, “Benefits and Challenges of responsible Open Science: Why does it matter?”🔗"

    "section": "Definitions of Open Science and responsible Open Science",
    "text": "Definitions of Open Science and responsible Open Science\nFormal definitions and governance mechanisms to ensure best practices in open science have emerged alongside the open science movement.\n\nIn 1997, COPE was established and has since supported the fostering of responsible publishing culture.\nThe 2001 Budapest Open Access Initiative provided a clear working definition of open access, one of the components of open science (as we will see shortly).\nIn 2012, the Contributor Role Taxonomy was developed so that more diverse collaborators in research can be adequately credited for their work.\nThe 2013 Declaration on Research Assessment then outlined best practices in the assessment of research.\nIn 2014, the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network was established to enable open science approaches to developmental research for the Global South.\n2014 also saw the launch of the Data Citation Principles, which advocate for – amongst other things – making data independently citable.\nThe 2016 FAIR principles emerged as a way to guide practices in open science, and enabled the implementation of the Data Citation Principles.\nThe 2018 CARE principles established data governance practices for indigenous data and practices.\n\nIn this complex context, we can draw on a few definitions of Open Science:\n“Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks” (Vicente-Saez & Martinez-Fuentes, 2018).\n“Open science is […] an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems (UNESCO, 2021).\nGlobally, Open Science is being valued and given importance as it recognizes disparities and regional differences, providing a framework to handle challenges and contribute to minimize knowledge, technological and digital differences between countries. For instance, when different researchers from across the globe are invited to research collaboratively, trust and novelty increases and as a result it improves quality, efficacy and responsiveness in research as being the benefits of Open Science.\nHere are some other definitions of Open Science. Are there any more you would add?\nOpen Science is a practice for increasing the accessibility and transparency of scientific research. The concept of Open Science is built around shared principles such as inclusion, fairness, equity, & sharing (Zee & Reich, 2018).\nAn umbrella term reflecting the idea that scientific knowledge of all kinds, where appropriate, should be openly accessible, transparent, rigorous, reproducible, replicable, accumulative, and inclusive, all which are considered fundamental features of the scientific endeavor. Open science consists of principles and behaviors that promote transparent, credible, reproducible, and accessible science. Open science has six major aspects: open data, open methodology, open source, open access, open peer review, and open educational resources.

The below list helps us reflect on the ambition that drives the open science movement. In short, open science is not limited to a discipline or a particular aspect of scholarly practice. Rather, open science seeps into every practice of scholarly work.\n\nOpen Access refers to making research methods, data and outputs accessible by default, where advisable; this is touched on in lesson five below.\nOpen Data relates to making data used in science accessible for others to study, re-usable for other pertinent projects, and available for redistribution. More on this topic will be discussed in the module Open Data.\nOpen Software is about making the source code of software transparent, allowing people to collaborate on its improvement; more will be said in the module Open Software.\nOpen Tools & Resources are those that have been developed precisely to facilitate open science practices, from open hardware and online toolkits to behavioral guidelines; learn more in the module Open Tools & Resources.\nOpen Results is a broad term capturing open access, open data and open software, as it is about making results from all stages of a research lifecycle open, including their evaluation, which should not be limited to traditional peer review; learn more in the module Open Results.\nOpen Educational Resources are learning and teaching materials made available through 📖open licenses📖 that permit no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptation and redistribution by others (see UNESCO’s explainer); note that the present TOPS OpenCore is an example of such a resource!\nEquity, Diversity, Accessibility and Inclusion are crucial values for the growth and sustainability of open science practices, as they foster the wellbeing of open science practitioners and communities. Shared principles about responsible scientific outputs also shape the behaviors of open science communities, with codes of conduct as a mechanism to ensure inclusive practices (see the following component of open science).\nOpen Community Practices refers to the fact that open science is conducted by communities of practitioners that foster collaborative working environments, beyond disciplinary boundaries and professions; this is touched on when discussing stakeholders in lesson three of this module."

    "section": "There is no one ethos",
    "text": "There is no one ethos\nIt is important to note that there is no one unique way of practicing or conducting open science. The outlined categories show us the diversity of practices involved in open science. Research has also shown that there are at least five schools of thought in open science, each one holding different assumptions and striving for different goals (Fecher & Friesike, 2013):\n\n\n\nFive chools of open science: infrastructure, pragmatic, democrratic, measurement, public school. Visit the paper for more details on each.\n\n\nDiverse practices, assumptions and goals are just part of the complexity of open science. There are also divergent moral principles guiding open science communities. Such principles are captured in 📖codes of conduct📖. A code of conduct is a community governance mechanism that outlines the principles and practices expected of a given research community’s members, as well as the process for investigating and reprimanding those in violation of the code.\nIn a sense, a code of conduct constitutes the moral backbone of a research community. However, as with the numerous schools of thought, there are similarly many codes of conduct. In other words, there is no one set of universal principles that all open science practitioners abide by. For example, consider how OLS, INOSC, allea, AGU and Ethical Source all have different codes of conducts and guiding principles.\nThis great diversity responds to the growing proliferation of open science initiatives and the great use we can make of open science approaches to knowledge.\nOne of the biggest driving forces is the effect of open science on the research performance. Indeed, some studies have even found that the best-performing universities are those that conduct science following open practices (see Huang et al., 2020). More will be said in the following lesson about the benefits of open science and different stakeholders.\nFor now, consider some of the regional policies encouraging open science:\n\nThe European Commission (2017) has outlined the skills and competencies researchers need to practise open science;\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2018) promotes open science by design as a vision for 21st century research;\nUNESCO (2021) has developed a series of recommendations to ensure best open science practices, which are conducive to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals;\nThe European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for finding and re-using data, and the Open Research Europe (ORE) publishing platform (European Commission, 2021).\n\nUltimately, open science practices guide approaches to knowledge-creation that best help confront the challenges of our era. Through this module and the wider TOPS curriculum, you can become a part of this impactful movement."

    "text": "Have you ever marveled at mesmerizing scientific visualizations and wondered how they were generated and whether you can recreate them or even maybe tweak them to produce new results? These types of images have been created by researchers using research software. These software products and sometimes their source codes are freely available to the public. Reproducing such results and using them to advance the knowledge produced by these types of research software products are among the pillars of open science. For example, Figure 1, is generated using E3SM, an Earth System model, the source code of which is available on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Global E3SM simulation showing eddy activity, credits M. Petersen, P. Wolfram and T. Ringler\n\n\n\nNow, let’s say that you are intrigued by the idea of recreating Figure 1 and tweaking the E3SM’s source code. We should start with obtaining the source code. Someone might ask since this project already has a fancy website why is the source code on GitHub? Let’s assume that we successfully got the source code and want to start recreating the figure. Naturally, the next question is how do we install it since there is no executable file in the source code? Maybe you are used to installing software packages using installation wizards, or maybe you are comfortable working from command line. Which one is possible or preferable for installing this software? The next step after installation is running the software and visualizing the results. So, the question is, for generating the desired outputs, how do we configure the software, what are the required input data, and how do we get them? Let’s take it a step further and say that you have some brilliant new ideas and want to implement in the source code, analyze the outputs, publish the results, and make your code publicly available. Therefore, the questions become: How do we facilitate navigating this seemingly complicated source code? After making modifications, are we allowed to share and republish the modified source code, and if so, how do go about it? How do we ensure that the republished code is findable and other researchers can reuse and build upon it?\nThe purpose of this module is to answer these questions, provide guidance for streamlining the workflow and ensuring that we give/get proper credits, and last but not least, draw your attention to and promote the importance of contributing and giving back to the Open Science community."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs mentioned earlier, data is a major part of scientific research, and why wouldn’t it be? It is evident that data permeates many aspects of our daily life with significant consequences.\nFor instance, it has become all the more common to see news articles discussing how data and efforts like Open Street Map are critical in supporting the disaster emergency responses all over the world 1. This is only an example among many others demonstrating the value of data, particularly open and public data, in our daily life and for public good.\nSimilarly, data shared openly in scientific research brings tremendous value which is not limited to the scientific community but extends to communities at large from indigenous communities to urban populations! Before we look further into this, let’s first look at what is data in scientific fields? What is open data? What are the key characteristics of open data?\n\nWhat is Data?\nData is any type of information, recordable or observable facts. Research data is thus data collected in order to answer the research questions of a project.\nResearch data can be numbers, texts, measurements, images, model output, and more. Research data is collected in different ways, and formats. Generally speaking it can be grouped in different ways, for example:\n\nQualitative data describing information in words\nQuantitative data with defined numerical information, e.g. from measurements\nGrouped versus ungrouped data; grouped data being data that has been put into classes for next steps such as interpretation and ungrouped data referring to the raw data 2\nStructured versus unstructured data: unstructured data referring to data in its raw format, and structured data referring to data formatted for storage in files or records such as relational databases 3\n\nIn the next section we will introduce the different types of data most commonly generated/found in research. This will provide an understanding of how different data should be handled and what considerations to keep in mind when sharing it openly. More on this can be found in lessons 3 (Responsible Open Data) & 4 (CARE and FAIR Principles). We will also highlight one particular type of data (metadata, described below) and its role in supporting the development of Open Data and Open Science initiatives.\n\nPrimary (raw) data\nPrimary data refers to data that is directly collected or created by researchers. Examples include surveys, questionnaires, interviews, physical samples, specimens, output from models, remote sensing data (spectral/photons), etc. Research questions guide the collection of the data. Typically, a researcher will formulate a question, develop a methodology and start collecting the data. Some examples of primary data include:\nResponses to Interviews, questionnaires, and surveys.\nTypically, interviews generate data, in the form of recorded audio ﬁles, transcripts, and notes and other observational data. Interviews can address a broad range of quantitative or qualitative oriented research questions, and may be used on their own or as part of a mixed methods approach. In behavioral and social sciences, these data collection methods are often used to collect self-reported data. A researcher designs these questions to collect data from participants that are necessary for the research. In most cases, this type of data can be openly shared under certain conditions or considerations e.g. if they are de-identified, and if the participants consent about the data being shared, more on that in lesson 2 and 3.\nData acquired from recorded measurements, including remote sensing data.\nIn many cases, the raw primary measurements from an instrument are processed in various ways such that what is typically stored and reported is based on a variety of calibration, normalization, and even compression steps that are ideally well defined and described by a discipline or measurement protocol. For example, satellite captured imagery is often used in online map services and navigation (e.g., Google Maps). These satellite imagery is often captured by various sensors onboard space-borne satellites (e.g., NASA Earth Observing System) or airborne measuring platforms (e.g., uncrewed drones or planes) [4]. These data often need careful calibration and correction including the values recorded by the sensors and the geospatial location of the imagery before it can be used appropriately for research and application. After the calibration and corrections, remote sensing imagery are often used to create products that can help us understand the environment that we live in and useful for societal benefits (e.g., studying air quality impact on community health).\nData acquired from physical samples and specimens form the base of many studies.\nTests and analyses are conducted on these resources, such as biological specimens, rocks and minerals, soils and sediments, plants and seeds, water samples, archaeological artifacts, or DNA and human tissue samples (Research Data Alliance Interest Group on Physical Samples) [5]. While it may be more difficult to share these types of physical resources, information about the samples and as well as data derived from using them, can be shared via thorough description, such as in the case of BioBanks, IGSN (a persistent identifier specifically for physical samples), and iSamples [6] [7]. For more information about how to manage physical samples, check out the 23 Things Physical Samples [8].\nData generated from models and simulations.\nNot all primary data are observations collected by people or instruments. We also build mathematical models either based on physical laws or empirical relationships to understand a subject or system. The model can produce a suite of simulations driven by various input scenarios or initial conditions. For example, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is an international project with participation from more than 20 earth system modeling centers to generate the historical simulation and future projections of the earth system under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios [9]. The Open Data generated in the most recent phase of CMIP (CMIP6) allows researchers to understand the impact of the changing climate to the ecosystem and our society. The understanding derived from CMIP6 data can then be used to inform climate policies and adaptation strategies. Model data are valuable assets because it can provide data that can be hard or sometimes impossible to collect in real world [10].\n\n\nProcessed data\nProcessed data typically refers to data that is created or collected by someone else and used by others.\nExamples include data from literature, academic publications, generated statistics such as government statistics, transcripts of recordings, and a variety of streaming environmental and biological data that are deposited and made available in databases and repositories.\nThis type of data is oftentimes used for a different purpose than originally intended, for example, from a previous experiment or from another research project or a different discipline.\nIt is very common in the era of digital scientific research to see new primary datasets created or produced by collecting and repurposing secondary data and/or mixing them with new primary data. This kind of research practice is made possible by the promotion of Open Data. Data sharing provides opportunities for all researchers, even the novice and/or unfunded, therefore leveling the playing field [11]. More on the benefits of Open Data in lesson 2.\n\n\nMetadata\nMetadata is a special type of data that describes other data or objects (e.g. samples). It is often used to provide a standard set of information about a dataset to enable easy use and interpretation of the data.\nIt can facilitate assessment of dataset quality, by answering key questions, such as including key information on:\n\nHow the data was collected (e.g. which equipment/instruments were used)\nWhich variables/parameters are included in this dataset\nWho or which organization created or collected the data\nWhen the data was collected and deposited\nWhere to find the data (e.g. DOI) and how to cite it\nWhich geographic region the dataset covers\nWho can use the data and how\nWhich version is the dataset\nWhat is the format of the data\nWhether the dataset follows any community or international standards or guidelines\n\nIn addition, metadata allows cataloging and data discovery specially, if it follows leading practices allowing them to be indexed by search engines (The Turing Way, 2019) [12]. In other words, it enhances searchability and findability of the data by allowing other machines to read and interpret datasets (see the concept Findable in lesson 4 - CARE and FAIR principles)\nIn later lessons, we will describe how to create metadata and where to find help (e.g. repositories)\nThere are different types/categories of metadata addressing different purposes:\n\nDescriptive metadata can contain information about the context and content of your data; such as, abstract, title, subject keywords.\nStructural metadata is used to describe the structure of the data (e.g., file format, the dataset hierarchy).\nAdministrative metadata explaining the information that is used to manage the data (e.g., when and how it was created, which software and the version of the software used in data creation).\n\n\n\n\n1.2 What is Open Data?\nThe term “Open Data” is relatively new with the first appearance in 1995 in an article in Paris Tech Review describing the need of sharing Earth and environmental data because “our atmosphere, oceans and biosphere form an integrated whole that transcends borders.” [13]\nIn this lesson, we are adopting the definition of “Open Data” as defined in the Open Data Handbook from the Open Knowledge Foundation [14] [15].\n\n“Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.” Open Data is defined by a set of key attributes, but keep in mind that not all aspects can or will be present at all times as there might be some considerations or restrictions to take into account. This could be partly due to the fact that Open Data does not necessarily mean Open for ALL, but rather Open for the specific individuals and/or communities, more on this in lessons 3 (Responsible Open Data) & 4 (CARE & FAIR Principles) .\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility\nOpen data is characterized by being available and accessible, meaning that it is published on a publicly available platform and accessible to download over the internet allowing others to find it and use it.\nIdeally, scientific research outputs including; research data, metadata, manuscripts, open educational resources, software, hardware and source code are published and made available in both human and machine readable.\nGenerally, Open Data does not require a payment. Nevertheless, in some cases infrastructure costs might be required which can be covered by societies, institutes, organizations etc. More on this in lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data).\n\n\nReusability\nFor Open Data to be useful, it has to be reusable. Without the capacity to reuse it, we are creating “data tombs” where the data is hosted (lives) but is of no value to others [16].\nThere are essential factors that need to be addressed in order for the data to be in good enough shape for others to use it .For instance, researchers and data reusers are mostly looking for data which is “comprehensive, easy to obtain, easy to manipulate, and believable”. For these criteria to be fulfilled the data needs to:\n\nSufficiently described with appropriate metadata, which greatly affects open data reusability. There is no one size fits all for metadata as its collection is guided by your data. More on metadata generation in lesson 5 (Planning for Open Data)\nHas appropriate license, copyright and citation information. See lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data)\nHas appropriate access information. Learn more in lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data)\nFindable in an accredited or trustworthy resource. Learn more in lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data)\nMaintained on a regular basis, addressing feedback from different levels of users\nAccompanied with history of changes and versioning (see definitions) allowing users to point to the exact state of data when they decided to use it.\nFor processed data it is also important to include details of all processing steps. For instance in the case for large data, e.g., it is not common practice for raw genomic reads to be preserved. In most cases processed genomic data are reported, and archived. Hence, some case sensitive data should contain information about processing steps (e.g., calibration, normalization) depending on varying instances.\n\n\n\nInclusivity\nData inclusivity refers to making the data truly open and available for all independent of nationality, location, race, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language and culture, ability and disability, political ideology, ethnicity or immigration status or any other grounds.\nOpen Data is free from all types of organizational, cultural, political and/or commercial restrictions. A good example of open data transcend national boundary is the world bank poverty headcount data, which is anonymously developed from primary household survey data of different government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments [17].\nThe inclusiveness of open data brings many benefits (Lesson 2 - Benefits of Open Data). However, there are situations when it is not ethical or appropriate to share certain data, or there are considerations to implement additional steps and policies to ensure the proper use of open data (Lesson 3 - Responsible Open Data)."
