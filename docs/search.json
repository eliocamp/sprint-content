    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis is the first lesson in the module on the Ethos of Open Science. We’ll start explaining what we mean by the word, “ethos”. Ethos is defined by Merriam-Webster as “the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution”. So this lesson is about what makes Open Science, as an approach to knowledge-production, unique or distinguishable from other scientific methods.\nNote that “ethos” is not exactly “ethics”, but it is a broad enough term to include the moral attitudes held by the individuals or institutions practicing open science. To make it clear that there is a moral element to this discussion, we speak of “responsible Open Science” going forward.\nThe lesson introduces the concept of open science as a whole, by explaining the history underpinning open science, what open science is, and how it works. It then discusses different components of open science and the pillars that make them up. At the end of the lesson, students will have an understanding of the brief history of open science and its definition.\nOpen science goes beyond publishing– it is a redefinition of scientific collaboration and output. It is a culture intended to promote science and its social impact. Open science creates new opportunities for different stakeholders including researchers, decision makers, and public participants. Open science increases study transparency, repeatability, reproducibility, and confirmation. We expand what these terms mean and why they matter throughout this module and later OpenCore modules."

    "section": "Context and Definition",
    "text": "Context and Definition\nScience evolves through collaborative development of theories and practices that are open for others to learn and build on. Throughout the ages - whilst in some cases, education and science was out of reach for the general populace and may have been kept for a privileged few, there have been other educational and scientific resources that were purposefully made available for others to re-use. Think of how dictionaries and encyclopedias have been around for centuries specifically to share standards of knowledge. (The first “dictionary” dates back over 3,000 years!) Libraries, in turn, have existed for millennia to serve as repositories of knowledge in diverse formats, from ancient tablets and scrolls, to the books we expect to see today. Public museums have also been around for some time and play the role of educating people, as well as maintaining archives for researchers to gain further insights from.\nInstitutions and practices throughout the ages have facilitated humanity’s endless desire for knowledge. As far back as the Medieval era, we already find physicians being encouraged to review one another’s work to ensure it was carried out appropriately (Rogers, 2021). Today, we call this practice “peer review”. And, during the Enlightenment, scientists formed networks with whom they shared their theories via hand-written letters, and the adoption of the printer allowed for the emergence of scientific institutes and journals (Green, 2017; see Kherroubi Garcia et al., 2022).\nHowever, open science has only become a distinct set of practices in recent decades. We can see open science as both being encouraged by social and technological developments, and responding to problems in the scientific process. The emergence of the internet and other digital technologies have more recently allowed for science to be conducted even more collaboratively. In 1971, Project Gutenberg started making books in the 📖public domain📖 available online. In 1987, we saw the first open access 📖journal📖 being published. In 1991 the central storage platform arXiv was launched for the exchange of manuscripts in physics (though without 📖peer review📖) (Ginsparg, 2021).\nHowever, these endeavors do not amount to open science in the sense we discuss it today. In recent years, we have learned of various issues in the scientific process that necessitate specific responses. Two such issues are the 📖replication crisis📖 (Fidler & Gordon, 2013; Elsherif et al., 2021a) and 📖publication bias📖 (Joober, et al., 2012; Elsherif et al., 2021b). The replication crisis refers to scientific findings not being validated by other scientists’ efforts to replicate them. The publication bias amounts to the greater ease to publish scientific findings that only “very clearly” confirm or disprove hypotheses.\nThus, open science captures both the spirit of making knowledge more accessible and responding to poor scientific practices. We will discuss more reasons why open science is important, both the personal benefits and as a public good, in 🔗Lesson 2 of this module, “Benefits and Challenges of responsible Open Science: Why does it matter?”🔗"

    "section": "Definitions of Open Science and responsible Open Science",
    "text": "Definitions of Open Science and responsible Open Science\nFormal definitions and governance mechanisms to ensure best practices in open science have emerged alongside the open science movement.\n\nIn 1997, COPE was established and has since supported the fostering of responsible publishing culture.\nThe 2001 Budapest Open Access Initiative provided a clear working definition of open access, one of the components of open science (as we will see shortly).\nIn 2012, the Contributor Role Taxonomy was developed so that more diverse collaborators in research can be adequately credited for their work.\nThe 2013 Declaration on Research Assessment then outlined best practices in the assessment of research.\nIn 2014, the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network was established to enable open science approaches to developmental research for the Global South.\n2014 also saw the launch of the Data Citation Principles, which advocate for – amongst other things – making data independently citable.\nThe 2016 FAIR principles emerged as a way to guide practices in open science, and enabled the implementation of the Data Citation Principles.\nThe 2018 CARE principles established data governance practices for indigenous data and practices.\n\nIn this complex context, we can draw on a few definitions of Open Science:\n“Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks” (Vicente-Saez & Martinez-Fuentes, 2018).\n“Open science is […] an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems (UNESCO, 2021).\nGlobally, Open Science is being valued and given importance as it recognizes disparities and regional differences, providing a framework to handle challenges and contribute to minimize knowledge, technological and digital differences between countries. For instance, when different researchers from across the globe are invited to research collaboratively, trust and novelty increases and as a result it improves quality, efficacy and responsiveness in research as being the benefits of Open Science.\nHere are some other definitions of Open Science. Are there any more you would add?\nOpen Science is a practice for increasing the accessibility and transparency of scientific research. The concept of Open Science is built around shared principles such as inclusion, fairness, equity, & sharing (Zee & Reich, 2018).\nAn umbrella term reflecting the idea that scientific knowledge of all kinds, where appropriate, should be openly accessible, transparent, rigorous, reproducible, replicable, accumulative, and inclusive, all which are considered fundamental features of the scientific endeavor. Open science consists of principles and behaviors that promote transparent, credible, reproducible, and accessible science. Open science has six major aspects: open data, open methodology, open source, open access, open peer review, and open educational resources.

The below list helps us reflect on the ambition that drives the open science movement. In short, open science is not limited to a discipline or a particular aspect of scholarly practice. Rather, open science seeps into every practice of scholarly work.\n\nOpen Access refers to making research methods, data and outputs accessible by default, where advisable; this is touched on in lesson five below.\nOpen Data relates to making data used in science accessible for others to study, re-usable for other pertinent projects, and available for redistribution. More on this topic will be discussed in the module Open Data.\nOpen Software is about making the source code of software transparent, allowing people to collaborate on its improvement; more will be said in the module Open Software.\nOpen Tools & Resources are those that have been developed precisely to facilitate open science practices, from open hardware and online toolkits to behavioral guidelines; learn more in the module Open Tools & Resources.\nOpen Results is a broad term capturing open access, open data and open software, as it is about making results from all stages of a research lifecycle open, including their evaluation, which should not be limited to traditional peer review; learn more in the module Open Results.\nOpen Educational Resources are learning and teaching materials made available through 📖open licenses📖 that permit no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptation and redistribution by others (see UNESCO’s explainer); note that the present TOPS OpenCore is an example of such a resource!\nEquity, Diversity, Accessibility and Inclusion are crucial values for the growth and sustainability of open science practices, as they foster the wellbeing of open science practitioners and communities. Shared principles about responsible scientific outputs also shape the behaviors of open science communities, with codes of conduct as a mechanism to ensure inclusive practices (see the following component of open science).\nOpen Community Practices refers to the fact that open science is conducted by communities of practitioners that foster collaborative working environments, beyond disciplinary boundaries and professions; this is touched on when discussing stakeholders in lesson three of this module."

    "section": "There is no one ethos",
    "text": "There is no one ethos\nIt is important to note that there is no one unique way of practicing or conducting open science. The outlined categories show us the diversity of practices involved in open science. Research has also shown that there are at least five schools of thought in open science, each one holding different assumptions and striving for different goals (Fecher & Friesike, 2013):\n\n\n\nFive chools of open science: infrastructure, pragmatic, democrratic, measurement, public school. Visit the paper for more details on each.\n\n\nDiverse practices, assumptions and goals are just part of the complexity of open science. There are also divergent moral principles guiding open science communities. Such principles are captured in 📖codes of conduct📖. A code of conduct is a community governance mechanism that outlines the principles and practices expected of a given research community’s members, as well as the process for investigating and reprimanding those in violation of the code.\nIn a sense, a code of conduct constitutes the moral backbone of a research community. However, as with the numerous schools of thought, there are similarly many codes of conduct. In other words, there is no one set of universal principles that all open science practitioners abide by. For example, consider how OLS, INOSC, allea, AGU and Ethical Source all have different codes of conducts and guiding principles.\nThis great diversity responds to the growing proliferation of open science initiatives and the great use we can make of open science approaches to knowledge.\nOne of the biggest driving forces is the effect of open science on the research performance. Indeed, some studies have even found that the best-performing universities are those that conduct science following open practices (see Huang et al., 2020). More will be said in the following lesson about the benefits of open science and different stakeholders.\nFor now, consider some of the regional policies encouraging open science:\n\nThe European Commission (2017) has outlined the skills and competencies researchers need to practise open science;\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2018) promotes open science by design as a vision for 21st century research;\nUNESCO (2021) has developed a series of recommendations to ensure best open science practices, which are conducive to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals;\nThe European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for finding and re-using data, and the Open Research Europe (ORE) publishing platform (European Commission, 2021).\n\nUltimately, open science practices guide approaches to knowledge-creation that best help confront the challenges of our era. Through this module and the wider TOPS curriculum, you can become a part of this impactful movement."

    "text": "Have you ever marveled at mesmerizing scientific visualizations and wondered how they were generated and whether you can recreate them or even maybe tweak them to produce new results? These types of images have been created by researchers using research software. These software products and sometimes their source codes are freely available to the public. Reproducing such results and using them to advance the knowledge produced by these types of research software products are among the pillars of open science. For example, Figure 1, is generated using E3SM, an Earth System model, the source code of which is available on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Global E3SM simulation showing eddy activity, credits M. Petersen, P. Wolfram and T. Ringler\n\n\n\nNow, let’s say that you are intrigued by the idea of recreating Figure 1 and tweaking the E3SM’s source code. We should start with obtaining the source code. Someone might ask since this project already has a fancy website why is the source code on GitHub? Let’s assume that we successfully got the source code and want to start recreating the figure. Naturally, the next question is how do we install it since there is no executable file in the source code? Maybe you are used to installing software packages using installation wizards, or maybe you are comfortable working from command line. Which one is possible or preferable for installing this software? The next step after installation is running the software and visualizing the results. So, the question is, for generating the desired outputs, how do we configure the software, what are the required input data, and how do we get them? Let’s take it a step further and say that you have some brilliant new ideas and want to implement in the source code, analyze the outputs, publish the results, and make your code publicly available. Therefore, the questions become: How do we facilitate navigating this seemingly complicated source code? After making modifications, are we allowed to share and republish the modified source code, and if so, how do go about it? How do we ensure that the republished code is findable and other researchers can reuse and build upon it?\nThe purpose of this module is to answer these questions, provide guidance for streamlining the workflow and ensuring that we give/get proper credits, and last but not least, draw your attention to and promote the importance of contributing and giving back to the Open Science community."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nAs mentioned earlier, data is a major part of scientific research, and why wouldn’t it be? It is evident that data permeates many aspects of our daily life with significant consequences.\nFor instance, it has become all the more common to see news articles discussing how data and efforts like Open Street Map are critical in supporting the disaster emergency responses all over the world 1. This is only an example among many others demonstrating the value of data, particularly open and public data, in our daily life and for public good.\nSimilarly, data shared openly in scientific research brings tremendous value which is not limited to the scientific community but extends to communities at large from indigenous communities to urban populations! Before we look further into this, let’s first look at what is data in scientific fields? What is open data? What are the key characteristics of open data?\n\nWhat is Data?\nData is any type of information, recordable or observable facts. Research data is thus data collected in order to answer the research questions of a project.\nResearch data can be numbers, texts, measurements, images, model output, and more. Research data is collected in different ways, and formats. Generally speaking it can be grouped in different ways, for example:\n\nQualitative data describing information in words\nQuantitative data with defined numerical information, e.g. from measurements\nGrouped versus ungrouped data; grouped data being data that has been put into classes for next steps such as interpretation and ungrouped data referring to the raw data 2\nStructured versus unstructured data: unstructured data referring to data in its raw format, and structured data referring to data formatted for storage in files or records such as relational databases 3\n\nIn the next section we will introduce the different types of data most commonly generated/found in research. This will provide an understanding of how different data should be handled and what considerations to keep in mind when sharing it openly. More on this can be found in lessons 3 (Responsible Open Data) & 4 (CARE and FAIR Principles). We will also highlight one particular type of data (metadata, described below) and its role in supporting the development of Open Data and Open Science initiatives.\n\nPrimary (raw) data\nPrimary data refers to data that is directly collected or created by researchers. Examples include surveys, questionnaires, interviews, physical samples, specimens, output from models, remote sensing data (spectral/photons), etc. Research questions guide the collection of the data. Typically, a researcher will formulate a question, develop a methodology and start collecting the data. Some examples of primary data include:\nResponses to Interviews, questionnaires, and surveys.\nTypically, interviews generate data, in the form of recorded audio ﬁles, transcripts, and notes and other observational data. Interviews can address a broad range of quantitative or qualitative oriented research questions, and may be used on their own or as part of a mixed methods approach. In behavioral and social sciences, these data collection methods are often used to collect self-reported data. A researcher designs these questions to collect data from participants that are necessary for the research. In most cases, this type of data can be openly shared under certain conditions or considerations e.g. if they are de-identified, and if the participants consent about the data being shared, more on that in lesson 2 and 3.\nData acquired from recorded measurements, including remote sensing data.\nIn many cases, the raw primary measurements from an instrument are processed in various ways such that what is typically stored and reported is based on a variety of calibration, normalization, and even compression steps that are ideally well defined and described by a discipline or measurement protocol. For example, satellite captured imagery is often used in online map services and navigation (e.g., Google Maps). These satellite imagery is often captured by various sensors onboard space-borne satellites (e.g., NASA Earth Observing System) or airborne measuring platforms (e.g., uncrewed drones or planes) [4]. These data often need careful calibration and correction including the values recorded by the sensors and the geospatial location of the imagery before it can be used appropriately for research and application. After the calibration and corrections, remote sensing imagery are often used to create products that can help us understand the environment that we live in and useful for societal benefits (e.g., studying air quality impact on community health).\nData acquired from physical samples and specimens form the base of many studies.\nTests and analyses are conducted on these resources, such as biological specimens, rocks and minerals, soils and sediments, plants and seeds, water samples, archaeological artifacts, or DNA and human tissue samples (Research Data Alliance Interest Group on Physical Samples) [5]. While it may be more difficult to share these types of physical resources, information about the samples and as well as data derived from using them, can be shared via thorough description, such as in the case of BioBanks, IGSN (a persistent identifier specifically for physical samples), and iSamples [6] [7]. For more information about how to manage physical samples, check out the 23 Things Physical Samples [8].\nData generated from models and simulations.\nNot all primary data are observations collected by people or instruments. We also build mathematical models either based on physical laws or empirical relationships to understand a subject or system. The model can produce a suite of simulations driven by various input scenarios or initial conditions. For example, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is an international project with participation from more than 20 earth system modeling centers to generate the historical simulation and future projections of the earth system under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios [9]. The Open Data generated in the most recent phase of CMIP (CMIP6) allows researchers to understand the impact of the changing climate to the ecosystem and our society. The understanding derived from CMIP6 data can then be used to inform climate policies and adaptation strategies. Model data are valuable assets because it can provide data that can be hard or sometimes impossible to collect in real world [10].\n\n\nProcessed data\nProcessed data typically refers to data that is created or collected by someone else and used by others.\nExamples include data from literature, academic publications, generated statistics such as government statistics, transcripts of recordings, and a variety of streaming environmental and biological data that are deposited and made available in databases and repositories.\nThis type of data is oftentimes used for a different purpose than originally intended, for example, from a previous experiment or from another research project or a different discipline.\nIt is very common in the era of digital scientific research to see new primary datasets created or produced by collecting and repurposing secondary data and/or mixing them with new primary data. This kind of research practice is made possible by the promotion of Open Data. Data sharing provides opportunities for all researchers, even the novice and/or unfunded, therefore leveling the playing field [11]. More on the benefits of Open Data in lesson 2.\n\n\nMetadata\nMetadata is a special type of data that describes other data or objects (e.g. samples). It is often used to provide a standard set of information about a dataset to enable easy use and interpretation of the data.\nIt can facilitate assessment of dataset quality, by answering key questions, such as including key information on:\n\nHow the data was collected (e.g. which equipment/instruments were used)\nWhich variables/parameters are included in this dataset\nWho or which organization created or collected the data\nWhen the data was collected and deposited\nWhere to find the data (e.g. DOI) and how to cite it\nWhich geographic region the dataset covers\nWho can use the data and how\nWhich version is the dataset\nWhat is the format of the data\nWhether the dataset follows any community or international standards or guidelines\n\nIn addition, metadata allows cataloging and data discovery specially, if it follows leading practices allowing them to be indexed by search engines (The Turing Way, 2019) [12]. In other words, it enhances searchability and findability of the data by allowing other machines to read and interpret datasets (see the concept Findable in lesson 4 - CARE and FAIR principles)\nIn later lessons, we will describe how to create metadata and where to find help (e.g. repositories)\nThere are different types/categories of metadata addressing different purposes:\n\nDescriptive metadata can contain information about the context and content of your data; such as, abstract, title, subject keywords.\nStructural metadata is used to describe the structure of the data (e.g., file format, the dataset hierarchy).\nAdministrative metadata explaining the information that is used to manage the data (e.g., when and how it was created, which software and the version of the software used in data creation).\n\n\n\n\n1.2 What is Open Data?\nThe term “Open Data” is relatively new with the first appearance in 1995 in an article in Paris Tech Review describing the need of sharing Earth and environmental data because “our atmosphere, oceans and biosphere form an integrated whole that transcends borders.” [13]\nIn this lesson, we are adopting the definition of “Open Data” as defined in the Open Data Handbook from the Open Knowledge Foundation [14] [15].\n\n“Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.” Open Data is defined by a set of key attributes, but keep in mind that not all aspects can or will be present at all times as there might be some considerations or restrictions to take into account. This could be partly due to the fact that Open Data does not necessarily mean Open for ALL, but rather Open for the specific individuals and/or communities, more on this in lessons 3 (Responsible Open Data) & 4 (CARE & FAIR Principles) .\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility\nOpen data is characterized by being available and accessible, meaning that it is published on a publicly available platform and accessible to download over the internet allowing others to find it and use it.\nIdeally, scientific research outputs including; research data, metadata, manuscripts, open educational resources, software, hardware and source code are published and made available in both human and machine readable.\nGenerally, Open Data does not require a payment. Nevertheless, in some cases infrastructure costs might be required which can be covered by societies, institutes, organizations etc. More on this in lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data).\n\n\nReusability\nFor Open Data to be useful, it has to be reusable. Without the capacity to reuse it, we are creating “data tombs” where the data is hosted (lives) but is of no value to others [16].\nThere are essential factors that need to be addressed in order for the data to be in good enough shape for others to use it .For instance, researchers and data reusers are mostly looking for data which is “comprehensive, easy to obtain, easy to manipulate, and believable”. For these criteria to be fulfilled the data needs to:\n\nSufficiently described with appropriate metadata, which greatly affects open data reusability. There is no one size fits all for metadata as its collection is guided by your data. More on metadata generation in lesson 5 (Planning for Open Data)\nHas appropriate license, copyright and citation information. See lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data)\nHas appropriate access information. Learn more in lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data)\nFindable in an accredited or trustworthy resource. Learn more in lesson 6 (Sharing Open Data)\nMaintained on a regular basis, addressing feedback from different levels of users\nAccompanied with history of changes and versioning (see definitions) allowing users to point to the exact state of data when they decided to use it.\nFor processed data it is also important to include details of all processing steps. For instance in the case for large data, e.g., it is not common practice for raw genomic reads to be preserved. In most cases processed genomic data are reported, and archived. Hence, some case sensitive data should contain information about processing steps (e.g., calibration, normalization) depending on varying instances.\n\n\n\nInclusivity\nData inclusivity refers to making the data truly open and available for all independent of nationality, location, race, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language and culture, ability and disability, political ideology, ethnicity or immigration status or any other grounds.\nOpen Data is free from all types of organizational, cultural, political and/or commercial restrictions. A good example of open data transcend national boundary is the world bank poverty headcount data, which is anonymously developed from primary household survey data of different government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments [17].\nThe inclusiveness of open data brings many benefits (Lesson 2 - Benefits of Open Data). However, there are situations when it is not ethical or appropriate to share certain data, or there are considerations to implement additional steps and policies to ensure the proper use of open data (Lesson 3 - Responsible Open Data)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The reusability of openly shared data relies on the prospects of it being found in the first place, therefore data findability is a key step in accessing and utilizing data. There are three major ways to find Open Data that are shared by researchers – repository, web search, and literature search.\n\nRepositories\nIdeally, Open Data should be available in repositories where the datasets are properly indexed and assigned a unique persistent identifier (as discussed in Lesson 6 – Sharing Open Data) thereby ensuring the data is unambiguously identifiable, searchable, discoverable along with associated metadata and documentations.\nTherefore, the first step in finding Open Data related to your field is to identify discipline specific repositories (if there are any) and search for datasets there (see Lesson 6.4 – Repositories and Other Sharing Methods).\nFind repositories in your field:\n\nRe3data.org is a global registry of research data repositories that covers research data repositories from different academic disciplines.\nFAIRsharing is a curated, informative, and educational resource on data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies.\nRecommended repositories by publishers (e.g., Recommended Data Repositories suggested by Scientific Data andPLOS One)\nWorld Data System represents a network of repositories.\n\nExamples of generic repositories:\n\nZenodo\nMendeley Data\nFigshare\nDryad\n\nTheGeneralist Repository Comparison Chart is a tool you can use to decide where to store and share their FAIR data outside of their institutional repositories. Dataverse has also published acomparative review of eight data repositories.\n\n\nWeb-searches\nTo explore a wide variety of datasets from projects or popular topics, the use of a more general search engine can be helpful. Some disciplines or large institutions such as NASA and the National Institute of Health’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) offer their own portal where you can search for their datasets, related publications and oftentimes tools for analysis (e.g., EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institutehttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/ ). There are also an increasing number of international and national data portals to enable data discoveries.\n\n\nGeneric data search portals:\n\nGooglehttps://datasetsearch.research.google.com/\nKagglehttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets\nWikidatahttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\nOpen Data Network https://www.opendatanetwork.com/\nAwesome Public Datasetshttps://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#readme\n\n\n\nExamples of Discipline specific:\n\nNASA Earthhttps://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/\nCernhttps://opendata.cern.ch/\nNCBI National Center for Biotechnology Informationhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nEMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institutehttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/\nISPCRhttps://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/\nInternational Monetary Fund https://www.imf.org/en/Data\nNOAA Climate Data Online https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Research https://fred.stlouisfed.org/\nUSGS EarthExplorer https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/\nOpen Science Data Cloud (OSDC) https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/\nNASA Planetary Data System https://pds.nasa.gov/\n\n\n\nExamples of National or international data portal\n\nUS Federal datahttps://data.gov/\nEU Data Portalhttps://data.europa.eu/en\nWHOhttps://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home\nTHE WORLD BANK https://data.worldbank.org/\nDATA.GOV.UK https://www.data.gov.uk/\nUNICEF https://data.unicef.org/\n\n\n\nLiterature search\nWhile not ideal, datasets are often attached to scholarly publications in the form of supplementary material, or referenced in text where to find them e.g. GitHub repository or personal/institutional websites. In addition, there are emerging journals and special collections/issues focused on describing and publishing data (e.g. Nucleic Acids Research database issueshttps://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1195, Scientific Data, Earth System Science Data, etc.). In other words, while the datasets are openly available in these media, they are not properly indexed and therefore not very findable nor machine readable.\nFinding academic publications can be a challenge in itself depending on the discipline and field of study. For instance, in life science and biomedical research, there are a number of repositories and search engines (e.g. PubMed, EuropePMC) indexing research outputs (e.g. publications, abstracts, references and communications) from various journals.\nHowever in other disciplines (e.g. arts and humanities), search is often carried out with general search engines or research databases such as Google Scholar and JSTOR. In that case, it is advisable to reach out to library personnel and community members for further advice on where to find related literature and data, see lesson 5.4 Help section.\nGeneric:\n\nGoogle Scholarhttps://scholar.google.com\nOpen knowledge map: A visual interface allowing the exploration of interconnected topics with relevant documents and concepts. https://openknowledgemaps.org/\nJSTOR a wide range of scholarly contenthttps://www.jstor.org/\nResearchGatehttps://www.researchgate.net/search\n\nDiscipline specific:\n\nEuropePMC Life sciences https://europepmc.org/\nPubmed biomedical literature https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\narXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for scholarly pre-prints in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics https://arxiv.org/\nBiorxiv Preprint server for biology https://www.biorxiv.org/\nEarthArXiv (https://eartharxiv.org) and Earth and Space Science Open Archive (https://essoar.org)\nASAPbio provides a catalog of preprint servers https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers"

This Module provides a collection of tools that are available to increase the visibility and discoverability of your project. It complements the previous OpenCore Modules (Ethos of Open Science, Open Data, Open Software, and Open Results) by enhancing the practical implementation of the Open Science concepts explained previously. While earlier modules focused on the concepts, advantages, and disadvantages of responsible Open Science practices, this module will focus more on the practical applications of responsible Open Science practices. We focus on a few key tools, and highlight how they fit across the research lifecycle.\nIn this first lesson, you will be introduced to the _What _and the Why of Open Science tools. First, we provide a definition of Open Science tools. Second, we discuss the differences between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ tools and highlight the advantages of using open tools.

    "text": "What’s the difference between ‘open’ tools and ‘closed’ tools? Why use Open Science tools?\nOne can intuitively grasp the difference between open and closed in relation to the “tools”, thinking of openness in terms of exchange with the environment. One should bear in mind that it is not a black and white separation, but rather a spectrum of options.\nWhen speaking of useful resources that you can re-use - such as text, visuals, audio, video - it is important to pay attention to the license on the possibilities and conditions for re-use. Lack of indication of a license leads to impossibility to re-use the material. As indicated in 🔗 Module 1 Ethos of Open Science, Lesson 5🔗, Creative Commons licenses is one of the most common set of open licenses given to written content of any kind, allowing re-use and requiring attribution, with a spectrum of openness, from least to most open (or CC0, equivalent to public domain).\nSoftware can be proprietary (“closed”) or open source. It is called open source when the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. Generally, software has a separate set of licenses designed specifically for code projects that covers both the open distribution of the code itself as well as executable versions of the program which non-programmers can run. More information and details on open software can be found in the 🔗Open Software Module🔗.\nHuman infrastructure refers to a network of relationships between stakeholders interested in the conduct and outcomes of responsible Open Science (more on those stakeholders can be found in 🔗Module 1, Lesson 3🔗). Communities – or groups of people who share a geographical location, affiliation, common interest, or practice – play a key role in the human infrastructure aspect of open science. As everything else, communities can vary in their degree of openness. A community can take the form of a mailing list, conference, meet-up or messaging app as a way to stay in touch. In that case, being open would imply that anyone could join the community and be welcomed to speak, decisions would be made transparent, and communications are largely public. On the other hand, a closed community implies that membership is restricted by invitation and/or a fee, resources and communications are not public, and decision processes are not necessarily transparent. More ideas on how to increase participation of stakeholders and how to build and lead inclusive communities can be found in 🔗Module 1, Lesson 3🔗 and 🔗this module, Lesson 4🔗.\n\nActivity/exercise\nNow let’s practice by looking at some typical case studies and solutions, reflecting on the benefits and obstacles of open and closed tools.\nCase study #1: Closed vs open resources\nCase study #2: Closed vs open software\nYou are a researcher who has been using a proprietary MATLAB platform to analyze data and create models. You are getting a new job, at a different institution. Unfortunately, the new workplace does not have a license for MATLAB, therefore you cannot access your own code and data, stored in the proprietary file formats, and moreover, cannot continue your routine workflow with analysis. What are your options now?\n\nYou can purchase individual license for this proprietary software, or persuade the institute to purchase a group or campus-wide license\nYou could consider using open source alternatives for programming and numerical computing, such as GNU Octave, Sage, or even Python programming language and its scientific packages. It would not only save you money now, but provide the continuity of the tool - if you move again, to a different institution.\n\nCase study #3: Closed vs open communities\n\nExample:\n\nOpen science tools provide numerous benefits, many of which have been discussed in the previous modules. For example, they can help you collaborate openly and share easily; organize and manage your work; track how your work is treated and shared; and follow leading responsible Open Science practices.\nOpen Science practices enable easier access to existing tools and resources that promote collaboration between professionals with similar interests and research objects. For example, someone in Asia wanting to study Central African rainforest species could visit an online species database made available by other scientists. Despite their physical distance, many reasons lead to inequality in access to scientific resources, from institutional barriers to paid content.\nThere are efficient and coordinated ways to share resources in general. One of them is using 📖version control 📖, which is a system to keep track of any changes made to one or more files over time. That also serves as a backup for your work.You might have already done that – for example, if you ever used Google Docs. It stores a version of your work as you type it, and you can invite other users to work collaboratively in the same document, keeping record of all changes made by all users.\nOne broadly used tool for version control is Git. It enables version control either online or on the user’s machine [see https://git-scm.com/]. Related services include GitHub, Gitlab, and Bitbucket. Information is stored in online repositories where people can clone, edit, and review each other’s content.\nAnother way to share your work is by using standardized 📖workflows📖. A standardized workflow is typically a sequence of steps commonly used for a given purpose, such as accessing and manipulating genomic data. A good open science practice, then, is to share those workflows in platforms such as https://galaxyproject.org/ – which allows any user to replay those steps right there for free, quickly and easily. That and other similar services enable you to show a step-by-step overview of what other researchers did, build on their work, and share your new ideas.\nIncluding 📖metadata📖, the data that describes your data, can significantly enhance the findability of your research object. Some examples of metadata are the keywords associated with a publication, the time range and instrument name of a given observational data set, and the ORCID number for a given person. Metadata is a tool that search interfaces use to more quickly find a resource. In fact, Google uses a metadata language called ‘Schema.org’ to build its search algorithm (see https://schema.org/ for more information).\nMany research fields have their own metadata standards (e.g. SPASE for space physics: https://spase-group.org/data/), but remember that each website you use has something similar behind that magnifying glass button. Taking the extra time to include some basic descriptors for your research object can make your contribution to your research field much more findable. The same way finding someone else’s work on the Internet might help you, making your own work more discoverable is a great contribution to Open Science!\nNext, we’ll highlight how open science tools and resources fit in the research lifecycle."

    "text": "How do Open Science tools fit into the research lifecycle?\nThe complex nature of research in the modern scientific community – involving multiple stages, steps, contributors, and stakeholders in the process – benefits from certain frameworks and definitions to structure, organize, and somewhat standardize the research process for the sake of responsible and reproducible practices.\nThe 🔗Open Results🔗 module introduced you to the definitions and nine stages of the research lifecycle and workflow. Let’s define these terms again.\n\nResearch framework\nResearch workflow\nResearch lifecycle\n\nThere is quite some theory behind the models for research frameworks, lifecycles, and workflows (REF), including linear, circular, multi-loop, and multi-step flows. For the sake of clarity and pragmatism of mapping the Open Science tools used within the research lifecycle, we will consider a concise 6-stage spiraling model for the research workflow, covering discovery, analysis, and writing as well as publication, outreach, and assessment (see Fig.)\n\nReference: Bosman, J., & Kramer, B. (2016). Of Shapes and Style: visualising innovations in scholarly communication. figshare. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3468641.v1\nMost steps of the research workflow are supported by online applications (Kramer and Bosman, 2016). These digital (Open Science) tools have actually influenced the way in which we perform and share research, opening it up to a global audience.\nOpen Science tools can be used for:\n\nDiscovery: Tools for finding content to use in your research\nAnalysis: Tools to process your research output, e.g. tools for data analysis and visualization\nWriting: Tools to produce content, such as Data Management Plans, presentations, and pre-prints\nPublications: Tools to use for sharing and/or archiving research\nOutreach: Tools to promote your research\n\nThe usage of such tools by researchers across different disciplines has been surveyed and reviewed in several efforts (Kramer and Bosman, 2016, Bezuidenhout and Havemann, 2021). Numerous digital tools have been mapped on the “discovery, analysis and writing, publication, outreach, and assessment” stages of the research lifecycle (see Fig). As we saw in the previous section, all tools have varying degrees of openness. Purposefully choosing tools to use at each stage to increase transparency, findability, and reproducibility, you are able to construct and define your research workflow in alignment with responsible Open Science practices. As was discussed in Module 1, Ethos of Open Science, open should not be a thoughtless default or afterthought, but included into the design and inception of the research project. Your choice of Open Science tools can be individual, but most often it would benefit from group discussions within your research team, institution, and communities of practice.\n\nNote: the concepts of workflow and lifecycle are widely used and applied to parts of the research, e.g. data. Data workflow, data lifecycle are discussed in depth in 🔗Lesson X of the Module Open Data🔗."

    "text": "How do Open Science tools address responsible practices?\nThe 🔗Open Data and Open Results🔗Modules introduced the concept of FAIR principles and discussed how their application according to best practices can increase the visibility and uptake of our research.\nLet’s refresh the terms:\n\nFAIR Data Principles - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, & Reusable. Wilkinson et al. (2016) provided FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship; Hong et al. (2022) establish FAIR principles for research software.\nCARE Principles - Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, & Ethics. Carroll et al. (2020) established the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance, complementing the FAIR data principles.\n\n\nBest practices to implement these principles include describing data using metadata standards and controlled vocabularies, assigning licenses, and uploading data to repositories that allow for creation of “📖persistent identifiers📖”. Examples of useful Open Science tools include:\n\nData Management Plan (DMP) tool, which allows you to create and share your data management plans to meet funder requirements and as a best practice for managing your data (link to website, to Lessons)\nData Repositories, which assign persistent identifiers to your data (example or link)\nTools for integration research management with DMPtool and repositories (example or link)\nCommunities - national and international, discipline-specific, or open science-centered - can be of incredible value in curating resources and building communities of practice for researchers and other stakeholders in adopting FAIR principles. Examples include the FAIR Data Forum https://fairdataforum.org/ and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) https://www.rd-alliance.org/\n\nWorking within the ethos of the FAIR and CARE principles can help to ensure that research is accessible, inclusive, ethical, and responsible. More about FAIR principles and practical steps to make your data FAIR can be found here: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"

    "text": "Self-Assessment: Questions for reflection:\n\nAssessment of your (open science) tools and resources\n\nMost probably you are already using some tools and resources, even if you are new to open science practices. Here we invite you make a preliminary revision of them:\n\nThink of all the tools and resources you use in your study/research/work and rely on - resources (content with text/media), software and communities. Think of all stages of your research - discovery, analysis, writing, publication, outreach and assessment.\nTools have varying degrees of openness, dictated by various factors. Imagine (or draw) the scale from 0 to 10, where 0 stands for completely closed and 10 for completely open.\nFor which of the tools (from categories of resources, software and communities) place it on the scale on a number that reflects the degree of openness.\nHow many tools do fall towards the lower part of the scale (0 to 4)? Take a moment to reflect if these tools are in line with your actual preference, goals and necessities in the long-term run.\nPerform a quick search using search engine or this open dataset of Open Science tools (https://kumu.io/access2perspectives/dost#dataset) for more open alternatives (e.g. free, open source) and jot them down “for your information”.\n\nIn the next lessons we will introduce you to various tools, which you may not have heard yet. Stay tuned!"
